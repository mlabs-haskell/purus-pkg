# Catalyst: Final Milestone Report. Providing Developer Experience

Milestone outputs:

- [x] Reusable project template (including a demo)

  - A reusable project template is provided here <https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/purus-pkg/tree/master/templates/default>

  - The
    [README.md](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/purus-pkg/blob/master/README.md)
    and [demo video](https://youtu.be/KxYRDXAH8cg) demonstrates how one can use the template.

- [x] Modified Spago (PureScript package manager) is made available to build Purus-based projects. Alternatively, an entirely new tool is available for the same purpose.

  - An entirely new tool,
    [purus-pkg](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/purus-pkg/tree/master), is
    available to build Purus-based projects.

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] A template can be instantiated and an example validator script can be compiled successfully

  - The project template provided here
    <https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/purus-pkg/tree/master/templates/default>
    can be instantiated and it demonstrates a validator script compiling
    successfully.

- [x] A bundler is provided, which can be used to build the UPLC binary from the source code with one command.

  - [purus-pkg](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/purus-pkg/tree/master) serves
    as a bundler which can build the UPLC binary from the source code with one
    command

Evidence of milestone completion:

- [x] A link to a commit where the objectives of the milestone are achieved. A
  video demo demonstrating the process.

  - A link to the commit to demonstrate the milestone objects are achieved is
    here
    <https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/purus-pkg/commit/b76d3fd26aea6fa0c904a9ca563ca1d541451c27>.
    Namely, this commit includes the implementation of purus-pkg (the package
    manager and bundler for Purus) along with a project template.

  - A video demo to demonstrate the process of building UPLC binary can be found here <https://youtu.be/KxYRDXAH8cg>

- [x] We will demonstrate how Purus can be used to produce a working UPLC
  binary from source code. Video will be provided.

  - The video demonstration to show how Purus can be used to produce UPLC from
    source code can be found here <https://youtu.be/KxYRDXAH8cg>
